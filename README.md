# ConnectFour
A single player Connect 4 program which uses a tree-based version of the minimax algorithm to respond to player moves.

This program was written by Daniel Stekol as an open-ended final project for CIS 120 (Programming Languages and Techniques) at the University of Pennsylvania. Some basic graphics code was provided as part of the assignment; game ideas and logic were implemented independently.

Java program files are contained in the "src" folder - the main playing logic is contained in the MoveNode.java and MoveTree.java files.

JUnit test cases are in the "test" folder.

Image resources are in the "files" folder.
